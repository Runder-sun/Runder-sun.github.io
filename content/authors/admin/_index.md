      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network‚Äôs architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hiüëã, welcome to visit my academic website! I'm a Ph.D student from the Digital Art Laboratory at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research is driven by a passion for exploring the frontiers of digital art and technology. I focus primarily on Virtual Reality (VR), AI-Generated Content (AIGC), and Large Language Models (LLMs).
